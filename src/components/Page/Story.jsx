            <p className={styles.paragraph}>“The Name is Power. Power is to hold the instrument with which to create Art

                <br/>
                These were the dying words cackled to me by the first Djinn I had ever hunted, eight hundred thousand years ago in a colorless wasteland. 
                <br/>
                It was an act of vengeance twenty years in the making; ten years of obsession, nine years of surveillance, a single year of preparation and a moment’s opportunity seized had left the object of my earned hate broken on the ground. There the eater of names lied, and there it mocked me as I taught an immortal thing death. The noises that emanated from the shattered pieces of the Djinn’s body could only very generously be considered laughter; it was like the sound of falling stone, mocking the frail breeze that had finally made it crumble.
                <br/>
                I have spent many nights of my twilight ignorance pondering those final words and countless nights more wondering why the others I would hunt laughed wordlessly as they died. Each prey slaughtered added another voice to the laughter, from a grinding giggle to a cacophonous howling. At the time, I thought this odd behavior was some form of postmortem posturing - a way for creatures made of meaning and context to display their dominance over mortality itself. Having heard their patterns of speech so many times now, I now understand that the source of this laughter is simple joy. It is the joy of a groundbreaking epiphany that leaves scholars guffawing and the mirth of an amusing contradiction that causes an audience to chuckle.
                <br/>
                Depending on your relative fortune in avoiding the plans of a Djinn, you may already have guessed why these Djinni laughed as they died. However, as the recipient of dissemination I have chosen for these texts happen to be difficult to control, I will state plainly that the collective entity known as the Djinni had discovered an Art of great Glory in my death-drowned vengeance.
                <br/>
                I dictate this text solely to express the Art those black-eyed angels had created with me as their unwitting assistant. After all, to create Art is Glory, and Glory is the name of the ultimate purpose, or as Kant would say, the categorical imperative. This text intends to fulfill that imperative by meditation upon the various lessons I have learned in the interim since the death of the final Djinn. What I have done - what had been done to me - was utterly irrelevant. I see no redemption for my slaughter nor finality for the Djinni’s legacy. I only hope to bring some semblance of understanding, especially to those whose lives have been stained black by the machinations of the Djinni.

                If you have received this text in a far future, you may even know of a supposed Djinn manifesto known as the Apotheon. This is that text.
